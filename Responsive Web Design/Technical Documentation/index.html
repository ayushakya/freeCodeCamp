    <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop mounted 10 feet high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. </p>
    
    <p>Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots â€“ the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling. </p>

    <p>Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition. Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup. </p>

    <p>The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own. An attempt to score in this way is called a shot. A successful shot is worth two points, or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6.75 metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games and 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) in NBA games. A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made. After a team has scored from a field goal or free throw, play is resumed with a throw-in awarded to the non-scoring team taken from a point beyond the endline of the court where the points(s) were scored.</p>
    
    <div id="regulation">
      <h4>Playing Regulations</h4>
      <p>Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA) or 12 minutes (NBA). Overtime periods are five minutes in length. Teams exchange baskets for the second half. The time allowed is actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active. Five players from each team may be on the court at one time. Substitutions are unlimited but can only be done when play is stopped. Teams also have a coach and other team personnel such as assistant coaches, managers, doctors and trainers.</p>

<p>For both men's and women's teams, a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey with a clearly visible number, unique within the team, printed on both the front and back. Players wear high-top sneakers that provide extra ankle support. Typically, team names and players' names are printed on the uniforms. A limited number of time-outs, clock stoppages requested by a coach for a short meeting with the players, are allowed. They generally last no longer than one minute. The game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee , one or two umpires and the table officials. The table officials are responsible for keeping track of each team's scoring, timekeeping, individual and team fouls, player substitutions, team possession arrow, and the shot clock. </p>

    <div id="Equipment">
      <h4>Equipment</h4>
      <p>The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends. Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems. A regulation basketball court is 28 meters long and 15 meters wide. Most courts have wood flooring, usually constructed from maple planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimensioViolationsn. The name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="Violations">
      <h4>Violations</h4>
      <p>The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled. The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession. The ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line, or touches any player or object that is out of bounds.</p>

<p>There are many violations that may occur during basketball play: 
      <ul>
    <u>    </u><li><u>Travelling</u>: The player takes more than two steps without dribbling.</li>
        <li><u>Double Dribble</u>: A player stops his dribble, then resumes dribbling.</li>
        <li><u>Carry</u>: Within a dribble, the player places his hand on the bottom of the ball</li>
        <li><u>Backcourt Violation</u>: A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it.</li>
        <li><u>Kickball</u>: Kicking or striking the ball with the fist.</li>
        <li><u>Halfcourt violation</u>: Team takes more than 8 seconds to progress the ball to the front court.</li>
        <li><u>Holding</u>: Player holds the ball for more than 5 seconds while being closely guarded.</li>
        <li><u>Lane Violation</u>: Player stays in the free-throw lane(key) for more than 3 seconds.</li>
        <li><u>Goaltending</u>: Defender's touching of a ball that is on a downward flight toward the basket</li>
        <li><u>Basketball interference</u>: Attacker touching a ball that is on the rim or above the basket, or by a player reaching through the basket from below.</li>
      </ul>

  <div id="Fouls">
    <h4>Fouls</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Personal Foul</u>: An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types of physical contact. These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well. Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful.</li>
      <li><u>Technical Foul</u>: A player may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike conduct. These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time. Repeated incidents can result in disqualification.</li>
      <li><u>Flagrant Foul</u>: A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul. This results in an ejection.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><u>Point guard</u> <code>(the "1")</code> : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.</li>

<li><u>Shooting guard</u> <code>(the "2")</code> : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense.</li>

<li><u>Small forward</u> <code>(the "3")</code> : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.</li>

<li><u>Power forward</u> <code>(the "4")</code>: plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense).</li>

<li><u>Center</u> <code>(the "5")</code>: uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.</li>
